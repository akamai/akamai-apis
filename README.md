# Akamai OpenAPI Specifications

This repository contains [OpenAPI specifications](https://www.openapis.org/) for Akamai APIs.

## Authentication

Before you can make any API call, create [authentication credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/make-your-first-api-call#create-a-basic-api-client). 

## Organization

      /examples
      /headers
      /parameters
      /paths
