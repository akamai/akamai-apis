    Gets details about an activation. You typically get a single activation from an `activationLink` when [launching a new activation](ref:post-property-activations) and following up to poll its `status`. For activations whose `status` is `PENDING`, a `Retry-After` header provides an estimate for when it's likely to change.

  summary: Cancel a property's pending activation
  tags:
  - Property activations
  description: |
    If you detect a problem with a property version while its activation is still `PENDING`, use this operation to cancel it. Make a DELETE request on the `activationLink` you get from the [Activate a property](ref:post-property-activations) operation's response. Once you DELETE the activation, it no longer appears in the [list of activations](ref:get-property-activations), but you can still [access it individually](ref:get-property-activation). If there are unexpected problems with an activation that goes live before you're able to cancel it, you often have a one-hour window to quickly fall back to a previous activation. See [Activate or deactivate a property](ref:post-property-activations) for details.
