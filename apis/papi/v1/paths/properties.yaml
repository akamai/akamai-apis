  summary: Create or clone a property
  tags:
  - Properties
  description: |
    This operation either creates a new property from scratch or bases one on another property's rule tree and optionally its set of assigned hostnames. Version 1 of a new property is created automatically. PAPI's ability to create and clone new properties means that you can design a system of rule templates targeted to specific domains, rather than maintain a single set of rules with conditional logic for your full range of domains. Maintaining properties manually within the Control Center interface limited you to that more consolidated approach, but you can deploy rules more efficiently using PAPI. In either case, PAPI makes it much easier for you to support a large, flexible set of domains.

  summary: List properties
  tags:

  description: |
    This operation lists properties available for the current contract and group. Use optional query parameters to only show properties that were modified within a specified time range or on a selected network. If you specify the `modifiedSince` parameter, `contractId` and `groupId` become optional. If you don't identify a contract and group, the operation lists all properties you have access to, modified within a specified time range.
  parameters:
  - $ref: ../parameters/modifiedSince-query.yaml
  - $ref: ../parameters/modifiedNetwork-query.yaml
  - $ref: ../parameters/contractId-required.yaml
  - $ref: ../parameters/groupId-required.yaml
