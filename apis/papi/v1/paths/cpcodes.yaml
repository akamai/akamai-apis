  summary: Create a new CP code
  tags:
  - CP codes
  description: |
    To create a new CP code, you need to associate it with a product. You can assign any CP code within a property's rule tree as detailed in the [Rule Trees](ref:rule-trees) section. You should match the same `productId` that's assigned to properties that invoke the CP code to the one assigned to the CP code, otherwise you may get a warning.

    To view or update certain CP code data, such as name, time zone, and purgeability, use the [CP Codes and Reporting Groups API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cp-codes/reference/api).

  summary: List CP codes
  tags:
  - CP codes
  description: |
    This operation lists CP codes available within your contract and group pairing. You assign CP codes to a property within its rule tree. To list all CP codes in your account at once, without having to filter the request by contracts and groups, use the [CP Codes and Reporting Groups API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cp-codes/reference/get-cpcodes). CP codes include information about their product assignment. When [creating a new property](ref:post-properties), you need to apply the same product you specified for the assigned CP code.

    To view or update certain CP code data, such as name, time zone, and purgeability, use the [CP Codes and Reporting Groups API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cp-codes/reference/api).
