  summary: Bulk patch a set of properties
  tags:
  - Bulk patch
  description: |
    Apply a series of JSON Patch operations to modify a set of property versions. Form this set of `patches` based on the [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) locations from a [bulk search](ref:post-bulk-search) response. Specify a set of new property versions based on the results of a [bulk versioning](ref:post-bulk-version) operation. The request is a bulk patch object. This operation launches an asynchronous process to update rule trees. To check its progress, run the [List bulk-updated properties](ref:get-bulk-patch) operation, whose link is available in the `Location` header or `bulkPatchLink` member of this operation's response. See [Bulk Search and Update](ref:bulk-search-and-update) for overall guidance on this feature.
