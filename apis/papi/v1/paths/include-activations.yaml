  operationId: post-include-activation
  summary: Activate or deactivate an include
  tags:
  - Include activations
  description: |
    This operation creates a new include activation, which deactivates any current activation. After a necessary delay, this activates your version's rule tree modifying how your edge content responds to end-user requests. To reduce software vulnerability, avoid calling PAPI with separate clients on the same data and frequent polling of status values, progressively increasing the delay.
