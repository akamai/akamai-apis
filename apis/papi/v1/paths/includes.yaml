  summary: List includes
  tags:
  - Includes
  description: |
    This operation lists includes available for the current contract and group. Use optional query parameters to only show includes that were modified within a specified time range or on a selected network. If you specify the `modifiedSince` parameter, `contractId` and `groupId` become optional. If you don't identify a contract and group, the operation lists all includes you have access to, modified within a specified time range.
