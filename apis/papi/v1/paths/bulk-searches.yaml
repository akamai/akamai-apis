  summary: Bulk search a set of properties or includes
  tags:
  - Bulk search
  description: |
    POST a bulk search object to search across all active property or include versions. Specify a [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expression to match their rule trees. This operation launches an asynchronous process to gather search results. To check its progress, run the [List bulk search results](ref:get-bulk-search) operation, whose link is available in the `Location` header or the `bulkSearchLink` member of this operation's response. After gathering completed results, you can create new property versions, bulk patch the rule trees, then activate them. See [Bulk Search and Update](ref:bulk-search-and-update) for guidance on this feature. Run [Synchronously bulk search a set of properties](ref:post-bulk-searchsynchronus) as an alternative to get completed search results directly. To perform simpler searches for an include's name or property's name or hostnames to which it applies, run the [Search properties and includes](ref:post-search-find-by-value) operation instead.
