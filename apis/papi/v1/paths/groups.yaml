  summary: List groups

  description: |
    You need information about the prevailing group to access most PAPI interfaces. This operation provides a read-only list of groups, which may contain properties. This operation provides a flat list of groups, along with `parentGroupId` information to structure them as a hierarchy. Each group also lists any available contracts that enable property features, but not which group contains a given property. Use the [Identity and Access Management API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/iam-api/reference/api) to assign properties to groups, and modify the group hierarchy.
