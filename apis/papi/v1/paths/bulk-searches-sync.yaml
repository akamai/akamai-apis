  summary: Synchronously bulk search a set of properties or includes
  tags:
  - Bulk search
  description: |
    Provides an alternative to the asynchronous [Bulk search a set of properties or includes](ref:post-bulk-search) operation. It yields completed bulk search results directly, but with possibly high latency, making it more appropriate to target for small-batch searches. POST a bulk search object to search across all active property or include versions, specifying a [JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) expression to match their rule trees. After gathering results, you can create new property versions, bulk patch the rule trees, then activate them. See [Bulk Search and Update](ref:bulk-search-and-update) for guidance on this feature. To perform simpler searches for an include's name or property's name or hostnames to which it applies, run the [Search properties and includes](ref:post-search-find-by-value) operation instead.

        This delayed response shows the completed bulk search job. Unlike the asynchronous [Bulk search a set of properties or includes](ref:post-bulk-search) operation, this response's `searchTargetStatus` is always `COMPLETE`.
