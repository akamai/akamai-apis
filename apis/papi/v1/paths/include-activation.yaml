  description: |
    Gets details about an activation. The response also shows the results of a validation against the rule trees of active parent properties that reference the include. While you can ignore any warnings that indicate non-blocking, logical inconsistencies, you need to resolve all errors to activate an include. You typically get a single activation from an `activationLink` when [launching a new activation](ref:post-include-activation), and you follow up to poll its `status`. For activations whose `status` is `PENDING`, a `Retry-After` header provides an estimate for when it's likely to go live.

  summary: Cancel an include's pending activation
  tags:
  - Include activations
  description: |
    If you detect a problem with an include version while its activation is still `PENDING`, use this operation to cancel it. Make a DELETE request on the `activationLink` you get from the [Activate an include](ref:post-include-activation) operation's response. Once you DELETE the activation, it no longer appears in the [list of activations](ref:get-include-activations), but you can still [access it individually](ref:get-include-activation).
