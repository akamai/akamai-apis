  operationId: post-property-activations
  summary: Activate or deactivate a property
  tags:
  - Property activations
  description: |
    This operation creates a new property activation, which deactivates any currently active version. After a necessary delay, this activates your property version's rule tree and set of hostnames across Akamai's network of edge servers, modifying how your edge content responds to end-user requests. To reduce software vulnerability, avoid calling PAPI with separate clients on the same data and frequent polling of status values, progressively increasing the delay.

    If there's a problem with the property you activated, you may have the option to fall back to the previous version. To build the request object, go to the `activationLink` from the activation's response and note down the `fallbackVersion` value. Within an hour of activating, POST another activation with `propertyVersion` set to the version you noted down and `useFastFallback` set to `true`. This disables the current activation and falls back to the specified version. A fallback takes a few seconds, but the option is available only if there have been no changes to the set of property hostnames, as indicated by `canFastFallback`.
