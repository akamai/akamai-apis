  summary: Remove a property
  tags:
  - Properties
  description: |
    Removes a specific property, which you can only do if none of its versions are currently active. Activating another property with the same set of hostnames automatically triggers a deactivation on the targeted property. See [Create a new activation](ref:post-property-activations) for details. A successful DELETE results in a 200 response with the confirmation message. Attempting to delete an active property results in a 500 error. Attempting to delete an unknown property results in a 404 error.
