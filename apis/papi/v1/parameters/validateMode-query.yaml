  With `validateRules` enabled, setting this to `fast` performs a quick validation check based on the provided JSON. This is faster than the default `full` validation, which performs more extensive checks on the converted XML metadata configuration. See [Validation best practices](ref:validation-best-practices) for more guidance.
