  Set to `true` by default. When `false`, skips validation tests that would identify potential problems within the response object's `errors` and `warnings` arrays. See [Rule tree errors and warnings](ref:rule-tree-errors-and-warnings) and [Validation errors](ref:validation-errors) for information on how validation data appears in the response object. See [Validation best practices](ref:validation-best-practices) for guidance on when to defer validation.
