  acknowledgeAllWarnings:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      When POSTing an activation, you can skip acknowledging each warning. With this enabled, you can omit the `acknowledgeWarnings` array.
    default: false
  acknowledgeWarnings:
    type: array

    type: string
    description: |
      Either `ACTIVATE` or `DEACTIVATE`. The default is `ACTIVATE`. Any new activation automatically deactivates the current activation. Note that if you were to POST a `DEACTIVATE` type on an active property, it would no longer serve any traffic. You'd need to modify your DNS configuration and specify a different way to field the traffic.
    default: ACTIVATE
    enum:
    - ACTIVATE
    - DEACTIVATE
  delayValidations:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This makes the operation respond with an `activationLink` more quickly. Some time-consuming validations ordinarily result in a direct error response. Enabling this delays them so that any errors appear later once you [Get a property activation](ref:get-property-activation). In that case, the activation's `status` is `FAILED`.

    type: boolean
