              type: string
              description: |
                Either `ACTIVATE` or `DEACTIVATE`. The default is `ACTIVATE`. Any new activation automatically deactivates the current activation. Note that if you were to POST a `DEACTIVATE` type on an active include, it would no longer serve any traffic. You'd need to modify your DNS configuration and specify a different way to field the traffic.
              enum:
              - ACTIVATE
              - DEACTIVATE

              description: |
                Indicates fast metadata activation state. A value of `steady` indicates the include is currently active or has been cancelled. Values of `received`, `lived`, and `deployed` represent progressive stages of activation, while `cancelling` happens either after failing a network safety check or in response to a [DELETE operation](ref:delete-include-activation). Note that the `status` member indicates whether the activation is live.
