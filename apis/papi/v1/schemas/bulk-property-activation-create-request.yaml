type: object
description: |-
  Encapsulates each batch of bulk activations. While essentially a wrapper for an activation object array, this specifies additional settings to apply to all activations within the batch.

properties:
  activatePropertyVersions:
    type: array
    description: |
      Specifies each property version to include in the bulk activation. Following bulk activation, this reflects the activation state for each property.

      type: object
      required:
      - propertyId

      properties:
        acknowledgeWarnings:
          type: array
          description: |
            Lists property warning `messageId` values to acknowledge, unnecessary when `acknowledgeAllWarnings` is enabled.
          items:
            type: string
        network:
          type: string
          description: |
            The network on which to activate this property, either `STAGING` or `PRODUCTION`.
          enum:
          - STAGING
          - PRODUCTION
        note:
          type: string
          description: |
            An optional log message for this property's activation.
        propertyId:
          type: string
          description: |
            Identifies each property targeted for activation. See [ID prefixes](ref:id-prefixes) for details on how to omit the ID's `prp_` prefix. Don't use this value if you want to exchange data with the Identity and Access Manager API. See [Manage properties and includes](https://techdocs.akamai.com/iam-api/reference/manage-access-to-properties-and-includes).
          pattern: ^(prp_|PRP_)?[0-9]+$
        propertyVersion:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The property version targeted for activation. Once activated, you can no longer modify that version of the property.
          minimum: 1
  defaultActivationSettings:
    type: object
    description: |
      Specifies activation settings to apply to all properties.
    properties:
      acknowledgeAllWarnings:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          For all activations, skip acknowledging any warnings for all properties within the bulk activation job. Unless this is enabled, you need to specify `acknowledgeWarnings` arrays with `messageId` warning values for each activation.
      fastPush:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Enable fast metadata push when bulk activating properties, `true` by default.
        default: true
      notifyEmails:
        type: array
        description: |
          Email addresses to notify when the activation status changes for any property within the bulk activation. Note that you can supplement additional email addresses for each property you activate.
        minItems: 0
        items:
          type: string
      useFastFallback:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          When enabled, rolls back to the previous activation of each property included in the bulk activation job. If you [bulk activate a set of properties](ref:post-bulk-activations), and then within one hour discover a serious problem you didn't previously detect, enabling this in a follow-up bulk activation request effectively cancels all the activations. See [Revert a property activation](ref:property-activation-error-handling) for guidance. Note that while the fast fallback option ordinarily doesn't apply to activations that affect a different set of hostnames, this scenario is unlikely when bulk-modifying properties.
