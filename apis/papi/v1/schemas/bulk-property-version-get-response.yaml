properties:
  bulkCreateId:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Identifies each bulk-versioning process.
    minimum: 1
  bulkCreateVersionSubmitDate:
    type: string
    description: |
      An ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the bulk versioning request occurred.
  bulkCreateVersionUpdateDate:
    type:
    - string
    - 'null'
    description: |
      An ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the bulk versioning request most recently updated with changes to versions' status. The value may be `null` when the bulk version request first occurs.
  bulkCreateVersionsStatus:
    type: string
    description: |
      Tracks the status of the overall bulk versioning request, either `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `COMPLETE`.
    enum:
    - PENDING
    - COMPLETE
    - IN_PROGRESS
  createPropertyVersions:
    type: array
    description: |
      Encapsulates information about each new property version to create.
    items:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required:
      - propertyId
      - createFromVersion
      - createVersionStatus
      - createVersionSubmitDate
      - createVersionUpdateDate
      properties:
        createFromVersion:
          type: integer
          description: |
            The property version on which to base the new version.
          minimum: 1
        createFromVersionEtag:
          type: string
          description: |
            The data digest of the version on which to base the new version. If the digest doesn't match the current state of the version, batch-versioning fails for this property. See [Concurrency control](ref:concurrency-control) for guidance.
        createVersionStatus:
          type: string
          description: |
            Tracks the status of the versioning request for this property, either `PENDING`, `SUBMITTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, or `COMPLETE`, indicating success. A `SUBMISSION_ERROR` means the versioning failed, for example, if the `createFromVersionEtag` didn't reflect the version's current state. A value of `INTERRUPTED` indicates a server error.
          enum:
          - PENDING
          - SUBMITTED
          - IN_PROGRESS
          - COMPLETE
          - INTERRUPTED
          - SUBMISSION_ERROR
        createVersionSubmitDate:
          type: string
          description: |
            An ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the request for a new version occurred. Note that this occurs asynchronously, and doesn't match when the overall bulk versioning request occurred.
        createVersionUpdateDate:
          type: string
          description: |
            An ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the `createVersionStatus` last updated.
        etag:
          type:
          - string
          - 'null'
          description: |
            A digest identifying a specific property version. When making any subsequent modifications, this ensures the integrity of the newly created version's data. See [Concurrency control](ref:concurrency-control) for guidance. The value may appear as `null` prior to the new version's creation.
        propertyId:
          type: string
          description: |
            Identifies the property for which to create a new version. See [ID prefixes](ref:id-prefixes) for details on how to omit the ID's `prp_` prefix. Don't use this value if you want to exchange data with the Identity and Access Manager API. See [Manage properties and includes](https://techdocs.akamai.com/iam-api/reference/manage-access-to-properties-and-includes).
        propertyVersion:
          type: integer
          description: |
            Reflects the new version for this property resulting from the batch-versioning request.
          minimum: 1
        propertyVersionLink:
          type: string
          description: |
            Provides an API hypermedia link to each newly created property version. Prior to creation, the value is `null`.
          nullable: true
  message:
    type: string
    description: |
      A notification in case the bulk request repeatedly fails to process.
