  includeType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The type of an include. `MICROSERVICES` specifies includes with a separate access control and activation flow, which allows different teams to work independently on different parts of a single site. In a parent property's rule tree, you add the `MICROSERVICE` includes to rules with mutually exclusive path matches. `COMMON_SETTINGS` specifies includes used across different properties that share a significant number of settings. In a parent property's rule tree, you add the `COMMON_SETTINGS` includes to the default rule or rules without any matches. By updating or activating a single `COMMON_SETTINGS` include, the changes take effect immediately across all sites that use this include. You can use this member for filtering and grouping similar includes together.

    - COMMON_SETTINGS
    - MICROSERVICES
