                Either `ACTIVATE` or `DEACTIVATE`. The default is `ACTIVATE`. Any new activation automatically deactivates the current activation. Note that if you were to POST a `DEACTIVATE` type on an active property hostname, it would no longer serve any traffic. You'd need to modify your DNS configuration and specify a different way to field the traffic.
