          Represents a customized XML metadata Akamai sets up on your behalf. You can invoke it in a `customOverride` object within the top-level `default` rule tree to make it execute after all other rules, typically to restore a desired state. Relevant response objects appear within the outer envelope's `customOverrides.items` array. See [Custom behaviors and overrides](ref:custom-behaviors-and-overrides) for guidance on custom overrides.
