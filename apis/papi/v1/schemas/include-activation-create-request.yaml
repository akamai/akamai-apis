      Either `ACTIVATE` or `DEACTIVATE`. The default is `ACTIVATE`. Any new activation automatically deactivates the current activation. Note that if you were to POST a `DEACTIVATE` type on an active include, it would no longer serve any traffic. You'd need to modify your DNS configuration and specify a different way to field the traffic.
    default: ACTIVATE
    enum:
    - ACTIVATE
    - DEACTIVATE
  delayValidations:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      This makes the operation respond with an `activationLink` more quickly. Some time-consuming validations ordinarily result in a direct error response. Enabling this delays them so that any errors appear later once you [Get an include activation](ref:get-include-activation). In that case, the activation's `status` is `FAILED`.
