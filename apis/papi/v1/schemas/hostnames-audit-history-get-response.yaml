                The type of action performed to the property hostname, either:

                - `ACTIVATE` if the hostname is currently serving traffic,
                - `DEACTIVATE` if the hostname isn't serving traffic,
                - `ADD` if the user requested to add the hostname to a property,
                - `REMOVE` if the user requested to remove the hostname from a property,
                - `MOVE` if the hostname was moved from one property to another,
                - `MODIFY` if the user changed the `edgeHostnameId` or `certProvisioningType` values for an already-activated hostname,
                - `ABORTED` when the user request to cancel the hostname activation,
                - `ERROR` if the hostname activation failed.
              enum:

              description: |
                Indicates the type of the certificate used in the property hostname. Either the `CPS_MANAGED` for the custom certificates you create with the [Certificate Provisioning System API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cps/reference) (CPS), or `DEFAULT` for certificates deployed automatically. Note that you can't specify the `DEFAULT` value if your account hostname uses the `akamaized.net` domain suffix.

              - CPS_MANAGED
              - DEFAULT

              description: |
                The edge hostname you point the property hostname to so that you can start serving traffic through Akamai servers. This member corresponds to the edge hostname object's `edgeHostnameDomain` member.

              type: string
              description: |
