  cloneFrom:
    type: object
    description: |

    properties:
      version:
        type: integer
        description: |
          Specifies the version of the property to clone.
        minimum: 1
      cloneFromVersionEtag:
        type: string
        description: |
          Performs an ETag data integrity check on the original property. See [Concurrency control](ref:concurrency-control) for guidance.
      copyHostnames:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Assigns the same set of hostnames to the new property, `false` by default.
        default: false
      propertyId:
        type: string
        description: |
          Specifies the property to clone. See [ID prefixes](ref:id-prefixes) for details on how to omit the ID's `prp_` prefix. Don't use this value if you want to exchange data with the Identity and Access Manager API. See [Manage properties and includes](https://techdocs.akamai.com/iam-api/reference/manage-access-to-properties-and-includes).
  productId:
    type: string
    description: |
      Unique identifier for the product. See [ID prefixes](ref:id-prefixes) for details on omitting the value's `prd_` prefix.
  propertyName:
    type: string
    description: |
      A descriptive name for the property.
  ruleFormat:
    type: string
    description: |
      On GET, reflects the property's current format. Otherwise on POST, assigns a specific rule format to the property. Ignored on PUT, since you need to modify the `Content-Type` to change rule formats. For details, see [Update rules to a newer set of features](ref:manage-rules).
  useHostnameBucket:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Available if you have the `Hostname Bucket` module added to your contract, `false` by default. When enabled, this creates a special type of property where you can add or remove property hostnames without incrementing property versions.
    default: false
