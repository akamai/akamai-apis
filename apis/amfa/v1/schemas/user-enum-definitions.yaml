    type: string
    description: |
      The status of the user account, either `UNENROLLED`, `ACTIVE`, `DEVICES_DISABLED`, or `PROVISIONING_DISABLED`. A typical life cycle of a user account in Akamai MFA contains these stages: `UNENROLLED` represents users whose accounts were imported from an external directory service, but have no enrolled device. This is a default status for newly created user accounts. `PROVISIONING_DISABLED` represents users whose accounts were imported from an external directory and are currently suspended by an automatic provisioning service. These users can't use the supported authentication methods to authenticate. `ACTIVE` represents users who enabled their accounts and activated their authentication devices in Akamai MFA. Active users need to have at least one device enrolled and verify their identity using secondary authentication methods before they can access protected applications. `DEVICES_DISABLED` represents users who unenrolled their mobile devices or had all their authentication devices deactivated by an administrator. These users can't enroll new devices without an administrator explicitly deleting or re-activating the devices.
    enum:
    - ACTIVE
    - UNENROLLED
    - DEVICES_DISABLED
    - PROVISIONING_DISABLED
