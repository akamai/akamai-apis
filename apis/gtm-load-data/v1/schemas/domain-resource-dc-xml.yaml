  Provides information that you need to specify when submitting load data for a GTM domain.

    properties:
      datacenterId:
        type: integer
        description: |
          The number of the datacenter (traffic target) being updated. This number comes from the Akamai code field in Control Center. To support legacy clients, we accept `region` as an alias for `datacenterId`.

      resource:
        type: object
        additionalProperties: false
        required:
        - name
        - current-load
        - target-load
        - max-load
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
            description: |
              The name of the resource that is being used to balance load. This can be any quantity you define. For example, a resource can represent connections to a database, bandwidth, hits, or anything else.
            xml:
              attribute: true
          current-load:
            type: integer
            description: |
              The current load on the resource in the given datacenter. For example, if the resource is database connections, and you have 50 connections, you would report 50 for this value.
          max-load:
            type: integer
            description: |
              If the load in every datacenter exceeds its target, GTM raises targets proportional to the difference between `max-load` and `target-load`. Set `max-load` higher in data centers that can handle more traffic when the whole system is overloaded.
          target-load:
            type: integer
            description: |
              GTM's load balancer begins to shift traffic away from a traffic target when the `current-load` exceeds the `target-load`. For example, if you want traffic to begin shifting away from a database location when it has 100 connections, you would set the `target-load` to 100.
  domain:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the domain being updated, such as `example.akadns.net`.
    xml:
      attribute: true
  timestamp:
    type: string
    description: |
      This should be the time at which the load was recorded, in XSD date format.
