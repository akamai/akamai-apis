  A digital certificate contains an electronic document that includes a company's identification information (such as the name of the company and address), a public key, and the digital signature of a certification authority (CA) based on that certification authority's private key. Digital certificates are verified using a chain of trust, which is a certificate hierarchy that allows individuals to verify the validity of a certificate's issuer. The latest BETA version allows for multiple certificates and trust chains submission (Dual-Stack enrollment).
