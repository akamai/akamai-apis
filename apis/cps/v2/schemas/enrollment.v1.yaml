  An enrollment displays all the information about the process that your certificate goes through from the time you request it, through renewal, and as you obtain subsequent versions. CPS is a certificate life cycle management tool. Once you obtain a certificate, you use it until it expires, in most cases a year from the date the CA issued the certificate. CPS automatically starts the renewal process 90 days before the old certificate expires. It then automatically deploys the renewed certificate when it receives it from the CA. A version label indicates this member is introduced in that version. A pre-version label indicates this member is removed in that version. No version label indicates this member is present in all versions.
