  An enrollment displays all the information about the process that your certificate goes through from the time you request it, through renewal, and as you obtain subsequent versions. CPS is a certificate life cycle management tool. Once you obtain a certificate, you use it until it expires, in most cases a year from the date the CA issued the certificate. CPS automatically starts the renewal process 90 days before the old certificate expires. It then automatically deploys the renewed certificate when it receives it from the CA.

  changeManagement:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If you turn change management on for an enrollment, it stops CPS from deploying the certificate to the network until you acknowledge that you are ready to deploy the certificate. You can test the certificate outside of CPS, on the Edge Staging Network (ESN), to make sure it works in your environment and then deploy the certificate. The ESN is a small network of Akamai edge servers built to simulate Akamai's production network to test most of your site or application functionality with current production version configuration options and functions. For more information on the ESN, see the [Edge Staging Network User Guide](https://control.akamai.com/dl/customers/other/EDGESERV/ESN-User-Guide.pdf). You can also contact your account representative with questions or issues with your service on the ESN.
  csr:

      When you create an enrollment, you also generate a certificate signing request (CSR) using CPS. CPS signs the CSR with the private key. The CSR contains all the information the CA needs to issue your certificate.

        description: |
          Enable OCSP stapling for the enrollment. OCSP Stapling improves performance by including a valid OCSP response in every TLS handshake. Specify OCSP Stapling if you want to improve performance by allowing the visitors to your site to query the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server at regular intervals to obtain a signed time-stamped OCSP response. This response must be signed by the CA, not the server, therefore ensuring security. Disable OSCP Stapling if you want visitors to your site to contact the CA directly for an OSCP response. OCSP allows you to obtain the revocation status of a certificate. We recommend all customers enable this feature. Use `on`, `off` or `not-set`.
