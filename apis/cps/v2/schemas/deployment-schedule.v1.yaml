  If you want CPS to automatically deploy your certificate, but you do not want the deployment to occur before a certain date and time, you can set a deploy after date. You can only set a deploy after date and time for the renewal of a certificate or for a certificate that is active on the network. The certificate may not deploy the certificate at the exact time and date you specify, but it will not deploy it before that time and date.
