  After you create an enrollment, you can have CPS halt deployment when the certificate becomes available, so that you can test and view the certificate on a staging server prior to deployment in the production network. If you do not want CPS to automatically deploy the certificate to the production network after it receives the signed certificate from the CA, you can turn change management on for the enrollment. This stops CPS from deploying the certificate to the network until you acknowledge that you are ready to deploy the certificate.

It is used in the `change-management-ack` API call to further specify the state of the change that is being acknowledged. We recommend you use the `change-management-info` API call, review the `validationResult` with its hash, and then acknowledge change-management using the same hash retrieved when running the Change Management Acknowledgment operation.
