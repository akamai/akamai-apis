  If you use domain validation, the CA that issued the certificate validates that you have control of the domain. CPS supports DV certificates issued by Let's Encrypt, an automated, and open CA, run for public benefit. Domain validation history allows you to view the history and errors associated with your Akamai managed DV certificates. These certificates expire in 90 days.
