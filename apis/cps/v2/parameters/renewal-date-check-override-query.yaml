description: |-
  CPS will automatically start a Change to renew certificates in time before they expire. This automatic Change is started when Certificate's expiration is within a renewal window, and system will protect against other changes started during this renewal window. Setting `renewal-date-check-override=true` will allow creating a Change during the renewal window, potentially running the risk of ending up with an expired certificate on the network.
