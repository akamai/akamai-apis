      description: |
        Returns details of a test definition execution. The response includes identifiers of comparative test cases that belong to the test definition. It also includes details about the test run in which the test definition was executed, including target hostname, target environment, IP versions, and notes. Depending on the execution's `status`, the response includes different objects. For the `completed` status, there's a `diffCount` object. For the `failed` status, there's an `errors` array. If the test run is in progress when you call this operation, it returns a 404 error.
