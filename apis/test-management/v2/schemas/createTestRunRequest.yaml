  Contains information about objects you want a test run to execute against an environment. You can test each of these objects separately in a request: a requirement, a config version, a test suite, a functional test case, and a test definition. You can also combine objects in a request based on the these constrains: config versions with test definitions, a requirement with test definitions, or a requirement with config versions and test definitions. See [Run a functional test](ref:run-a-functional-test) and [Run a comparative test](ref:run-a-comparative-test).
