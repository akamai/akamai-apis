  Contains the test catalog template used for creating conditions. Conditions have a sentence-like structure. The template provides the list of available building blocks, `conditionNodes`, and combinations in which you can combine them, `triggerMappings`. See detailed descriptions of Conditions and Test catalog template in the [Test Center concepts](ref:test-center-concepts) section.

        description: |
          Contains the sequence of subsequently triggered condition nodes that you need to follow to create a valid condition. Each value selected from the `conditionNodeId` of `1` in the `conditionNodes` array, triggers different order of combining the condition nodes. You need to follow the `triggerMappings` flow, until you construct the needed condition and the `validPath` for the last triggered conditionNode is `true`.
