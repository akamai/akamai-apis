        Get a specific test definition execution. The response includes the test case IDs of the test cases that belong to the test definitions that were included in the test run. Target hostname, target environment, IP versions, and notes are included in this object, for a test run. When the status is `completed` there is a diffCount object. When the status is `failed` there is an errors array.  If the test run is in progress when you request to get an execution, the API returns a 404 error.
