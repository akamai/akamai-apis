    Delete the specified security policy. You can't delete a security policy that is actively in use. Before you run this operation, create a new version of your security configuration and omit the policy you want to delete. Once you have activated your new configuration version, you can delete the security policy you omitted from the new version. One way to create a new configuration quickly is to run [Clone a configuration version](ref:post-config-versions), remove the policy you want to delete, then PUT the edited object back to [Modify a security policy](ref:put-policy). _Products:_ Kona Site Defender, App & API Protector with the Advanced Security module.
