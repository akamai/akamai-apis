  - Activations
  description: |
    Activates one or more configurations globally. Note that you need to explicitly list any invalid hosts in the `acknowledgedInvalidHostsByConfig` parameter in order to successfully activate a configuration that includes invalid hostnames. If you have an invalid hostname that isn't explicitly called out you'll receive an error telling you to add them to `acknowledgedInvalidHostsByConfig`. See [Activate with invalid hostnames](ref:activate-with-invalid-hostnames) for instructions. _Products:_ All.
