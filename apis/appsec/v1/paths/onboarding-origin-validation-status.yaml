    Lists the DNS records for your origin. Once you make this call, visit your DNS provider account and create a new DNS type `A` record with the values returned in the response. In the rare case that you changed your origin values outside this setup, you can run [Skip origin validation](doc:post-skip-onboarding-origin-validation) to proceed to the next step without validating your origin at this time.
