  summary: Get the attack payload log settings for a configuration
  tags:
  - Attack payload logs
  description: |
    Lists attack payload log settings for a configuration. When set to `NONE`, the request body and response body show as redacted in the log. For example, `JSON_PAIRS:redacted`. Attack payload logging is on by default, and in most cases you should leave it enabled. This operation applies at the configuration level, and therefore applies to all policies within a configuration. If you want to view these settings for a specific policy, run [Get attack payload logging settings for a policy](ref:get-policies-attack-payload-logging). _Products:_ All.

    Enable, disable, or update attack payload log settings for a configuration. When set to `NONE`, the request body and response body show as redacted in the log. For example, `JSON_PAIRS:redacted`. When set to `RESPONSE_BODY` or `REQUEST_BODY` the log shows only the string flagged as a possible attack, and not the entire request or response body. This operation applies at the configuration level, and therefore applies to all policies within a configuration. If you want to override these settings for a specific policy, run [Modify attack payload log settings for a policy](ref:put-policies-attack-payload-logging). _Products:_ All.
