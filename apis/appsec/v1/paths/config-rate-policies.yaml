    Create a new rate policy for a specific configuration version. Now you can match on defined or undefined resources. If you're setting a match for either resource type, both `definedResources` and `undefinedResources` must be present in the request object or the request is considered incomplete. When `true`, match on _any_ defined resources without passing a `resourceId`. When `false`, you'll need to pass a `resourceId`. If you pass `definedResources` and `undefinedResources` with empty values, they default to `false`. You can omit both resources and use this operation without these new match criteria. Contact your account team if you'd like to match on `definedResources` or `undefinedResources`. _Products:_ All.
