  summary: Compare two versions
  tags:
  - Configuration version diff
  description: |
    This operation shows you differences between configuration versions. The `to` version is relative to the `from` version, and the versions you compare can be non-sequential. This means the `from` value can be more a more recent version than the `to` value. For more information, see [Diff configuration versions](ref:diff-configuration-versions).

        The response object represents much the same data as the [Export a configuration version](ref:get-export-config-version) operation, but substituting additional objects that represent diffs. The structure of these diffs vary when comparing different types of data: simple values, simple arrays, objects, and object arrays.  For details on the diff format, see [Diff configuration versions](ref:diff-configuration-versions).
