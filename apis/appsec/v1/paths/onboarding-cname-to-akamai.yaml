    Validates your site is ready to serve traffic. Call this operation after you've replaced the DNS entry that directs traffic to your site with the DNS CNAME records in [List hostname CNAME DNS records](doc:get-onboarding-cname-records). In each record, set the time-to-live (TTL) to 300 seconds (5 minutes). Once this call completes, run [Get an onboarding](doc:get-onboarding) to verify your onboarding is complete. When you've successfully completed any validations and CNAME changes, you'll see `onboardingStatus: "COMPLETE"` in the response.
