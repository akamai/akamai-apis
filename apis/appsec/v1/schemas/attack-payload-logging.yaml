      Use `ATTACK_PAYLOAD` to log attack payloads for all requests, or use `NONE` if you don't want to log the attack payloads. Note that when `type` is `NONE`, you'll see redacted in the logging information instead of a blank space or sensitive information. For example, `JSON_PAIRS:redacted`.
    enum:
    - ATTACK_PAYLOAD
    - NONE
