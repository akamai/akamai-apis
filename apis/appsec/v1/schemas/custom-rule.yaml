When `INACTIVE`, the rule doesn't trigger. When `EXPIRING`, the rule still triggers because it's still active until its specified expiration date. When the rule's status is `EXPIRED`, the rule is inactive and doesn't trigger. If your rule expires and you want to use it again, make a PUT request to [Modify a custom rule](ref:put-config-custom-rule) with the new dates you'd like the rule to be active.
