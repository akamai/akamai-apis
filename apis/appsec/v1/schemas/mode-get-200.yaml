      The security policy mode. Use `KRS` to update manually, or `AAG` to update automatically. For Adaptive Security Engine rule sets, use `ASE_AUTO` for automatic updates to the ASE evaluation rules, or `ASE_MANUAL` to manually retrieve current evaluation rules. When not specified, the mode uses default settings. For a KRS 1.0 policy, that means using the KRS 1.0 rule set.
    enum:
    - KRS
    - AAG
    - ASE_AUTO
    - ASE_MANUAL
