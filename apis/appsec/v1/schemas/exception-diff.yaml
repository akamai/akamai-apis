      The list of request attributes to treat as rule or attack group exceptions. The possible values are `REQUEST_COOKIES`, `JSON_PAIRS` for a JSON parameter, `XML_PAIRS` for an XML parameter, `ARGS` for a request parameter, and `REQUEST_HEADERS` for a request header. Use this option if you can't get an exhaustive list of elements to exclude or the list is too large. You can exclude several attributes.
