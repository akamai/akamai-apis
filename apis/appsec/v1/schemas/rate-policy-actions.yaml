            The IPv4 action to assign to this rate policy. For `BOTMAN` policies, choose `monitor`, `delay`, `slow`, `deny`,` tarpit`, `none`, or a custom action. For `WAF` policies, choose `alert`, `deny`, `challenge_{id}`, or `none`. Or use `deny_custom_{custom_deny_id}` to apply a custom action to your WAF rate policy. Run [Modify a custom deny action](ref:put-custom-deny) to manage your custom deny actions. If the action is `none`, the rate policy is inactive in the policy. Refer to [Challenge actions](https://techdocs.akamai.com/bot-manager/reference/post-challenge-action) for `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operation details.

For `WAF` policies, choose `alert`, `deny`, `challenge_{id}`, or `none`. Or use `deny_custom_{custom_deny_id}` to apply a custom action to your WAF rate policy. Run [Modify a custom deny action](ref:put-custom-deny) to manage your custom deny actions. If the action is `none`, the rate policy is inactive in the policy.
