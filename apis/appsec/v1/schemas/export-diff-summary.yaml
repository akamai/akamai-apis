  The response object represents much the same data as the [Export a configuration version](ref:get-export-config-version) operation, but substituting additional objects that represent diffs. The structure of these diffs vary when comparing different types of data: simple values, simple arrays, objects, and object arrays.  For details on the diff format, see [Diff configuration versions](ref:diff-configuration-versions).
