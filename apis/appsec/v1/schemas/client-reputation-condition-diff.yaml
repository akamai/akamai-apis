      Identifies the reputation category. Web scrapers (`WEBSCRP`) crawl sites and collect data like hotel rates, product prices, store locations, and more. DoS attackers (`DOSATCK`) are web clients or botnets that use automated tools to launch volumetric Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Web attackers (`WEBATCK`) target websites and web apps with techniques like SQL injection, remote file inclusion, or cross-site scripting. Scanning tools (`SCANTL`) probe web apps for vulnerabilities during an attack's reconnaissance phase. (This object [represents a diff](doc:diff-configuration-versions) of array data.)
