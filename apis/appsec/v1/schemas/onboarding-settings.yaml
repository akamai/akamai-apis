If, for example, your account is limited to 5 certificates and your account already has 5, then you won't be able to create a new one.

          Specifies whether the security configuration is `NEW`, or you're using an `EXISTING` one. Note than when you use an existing configuration, the onboarding process creates a new version of the configuration from _the version that is currently active_ on the production network. If no version is active on production, the clone will be the most recent version of the configuration. For example, if you have version 14 active on production out of 23 versions, version 14 is the version that is cloned when you create a new onboarding. If there is no active version on production and there are 23 versions of the configuration, it is version 23 that's cloned.
