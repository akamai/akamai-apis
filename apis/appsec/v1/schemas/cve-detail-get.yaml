      How Akamai services protect against a CVE:

      - `WAF` and `CUSTOM_RULE`: The Adaptive Security Engine (ASE) or a custom rule can protect against this CVE. You can verify which attack group or rule ID covers them.
      - `LOCAL_VULNERABILITY` or `NON_HTTP`: These CVEs don't apply to Akamai Web Application Firewall (WAF). They can be exploited only locally, or are a non-HTTP vulnerability.
      - `INSUFFICIENT_EXPLOIT_INFO`: Our threat research team didn't find any exploit for these CVEs.

      __Note__. Your rules need to be set to `DENY` to protect against a CVE. Rules set to `ALERT` or `NONE` still allow traffic through even when the rule recognizes a threat from a CVE.
    enum:
    - WAF
    - LOCAL_VULNERABILITY
    - INSUFFICIENT_EXPLOIT_INFO
    - NON_HTTP
    - CUSTOM_RULE

      The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) range that is between 0 and 10, with 10 being the most severe.

  impactSeverity:
    type: string
    description: |
      The severity level, either `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, or `NOT_AVAILABLE`. If any of these fields return `NOT_AVAILABLE`, there isn't enough data for NVD to categorize it.

    - CRITICAL
    - HIGH
    - MEDIUM
    - LOW
    - NOT_AVAILABLE
