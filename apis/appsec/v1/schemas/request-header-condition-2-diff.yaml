      The type of condition. The `RequestHeaderCondition` type checks for a header from the requesting client and determines if it matches a provided header. This subtype supports the `?` wildcard to match any single character and the `*` wildcard to match any sequence of 0 or more characters. You can also match on case sensitivity. (This object [represents a diff](doc:diff-configuration-versions)).
