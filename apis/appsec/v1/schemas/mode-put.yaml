      The security policy rule update mode. Use `KRS` to update rules manually, or `AAG` to update rules automatically. For Adaptive Security Engine (ASE), use `ASE_AUTO` for automatic updates or `ASE_MANUAL` to manually get current rules. When switching from one mode to another, any rule actions you have migrate to the new mode. For example, your rule actions for `ASE_AUTO` become the rule actions for `ASE_MANUAL` when you switch from auto to manual modes, and vice versa. Rule actions for `ASE_AUTO` are currently in beta. Contact your account team to access this option.
    enum:
    - KRS
    - AAG
    - ASE_AUTO
    - ASE_MANUAL
