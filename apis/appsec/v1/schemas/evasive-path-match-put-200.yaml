      When enabled, evaluates requests with the following list of characters removed ` & ! $ ' ( ) + , [ ] * @ ^ \ "` and `.` only when it appears as a trailing character at the end of the URL.  This feature does not match on characters that are an integral part of URL requests, like: ``` :  /  #  &  ;  = ``` and `.` when it appears inside the URL string.
