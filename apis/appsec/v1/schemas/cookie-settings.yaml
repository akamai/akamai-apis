      Choose the type of domain. The default recommended type is `automatic`. Otherwise, choose `fqdn` to use the current Fully Qualified Domain name, `legacy` to use the original way in which the domain was selected, or `psl` to use the public suffix list to identify a private domain.
    enum:
    - automatic
    - fqdn
    - legacy
    - psl
  useAllSecureTraffic:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If all of your traffic uses HTTPS, specify `true`. This option sets the Secure flag on all security product cookies, which are then only included with HTTPS traffic. It also adds `SameSite=None` to most bot management cookies, ensuring that recent browser versions submit the cookies with protected requests. The `SameSite=None` cookie setting is necessary for site architectures that involve cross-domain form submission or inclusion of cross-domain iframes.
