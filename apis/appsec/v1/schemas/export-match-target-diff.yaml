      Describes the rule to match on paths. Either `NO_MATCH` not to match on the default file, `BASE_MATCH` to match only requests for top-level hostnames ending in a trailing slash, or `RECURSIVE_MATCH` to match all requests for paths that end in a trailing slash. The default value is `NO_MATCH`. (This object [represents a diff](doc:diff-configuration-versions)).
