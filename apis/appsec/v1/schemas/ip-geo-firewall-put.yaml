      The method by which you block or allow requests by IP or geographic location. In Control Center, this is called `mode`. Use `blockSpecificIPGeo` to block any IPs, subnets, geographies, or network lists you specify. Use `blockAllTrafficExceptAllowedIPs` to allow requests from IPs, subnets, geographies or networks lists in your `blockExceptions` maintained in [Network Lists API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/network-lists/reference/api).
