            The action to assign to this custom rule, either `alert`, `deny`, or `none`. Use `deny_custom_{custom_deny_id}` to apply a custom action instead of Akamai's default. Run [Modify a custom deny action](ref:put-custom-deny) to manage your custom deny actions. If the action is `none`, the rule is inactive in the policy.

Either `activated` if a rule is enabled in at least one security policy within a security configuration currently active in production, `published` if a rule is associated with at least one security policy in an inactive security configuration, or `unused` if a rule exists as a shared resource, but isn't associated with any security policy.
