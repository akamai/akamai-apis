            The action to assign to this custom rule, either `alert`, `deny`, or `none`. Use `deny_custom_{custom_deny_id}` to apply a custom action instead of Akamai's default. Run [Modify a custom deny action](ref:put-custom-deny) to manage your custom deny actions. If the action is `none`, the rule is inactive in the policy.
