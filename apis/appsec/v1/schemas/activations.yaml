        The list of invalid hostnames in the security configuration to activate. In some cases, you may want to activate a security configuration with hostnames that WAF can't protect (for example, hostnames not managed as Akamai properties, or managed under a different contract than the configuration). By default, the existence of invalid hostnames blocks activation with a warning. The warning includes the names of the invalid hostnames. If you want to activate a configuration with invalid hostnames, enter the hostnames in this array. This field is now deprecated. Use `acknowledgedInvalidHostsByConfig` instead.
