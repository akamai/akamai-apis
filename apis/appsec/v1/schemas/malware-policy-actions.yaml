            The action triggered when malware is found or when there is a content type mismatch, either `alert`, `deny`, or `none`. Use `deny_custom_{custom_deny_id}` to apply a custom action instead of Akamai's default. Run [Modify a custom deny action](ref:put-custom-deny) to manage your custom deny actions. If the action is `none`, the malware policy is inactive in the security configuration.

          - alert

            The action to take when a file is larger than the 5MB scan limit or, in the case of a multipart request, if there are more than 10 files where the total file size exceeds 30 MB. either `alert`, `deny`, or `none`. Use `deny_custom_{custom_deny_id}` to apply a custom action instead of Akamai's default. Run [Modify a custom deny action](ref:put-custom-deny) to manage your custom deny actions. If the action is `none`, the malware policy is inactive in the security configuration.
