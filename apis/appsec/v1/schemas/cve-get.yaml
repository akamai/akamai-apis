      How Akamai services protect against a CVE:

      - `WAF` and `CUSTOM_RULE`: The Adaptive Security Engine (ASE) or a custom rule can protect against this CVE. You can verify which attack group or rule ID covers them.
      - `LOCAL_VULNERABILITY` or `NON_HTTP`: These CVEs don't apply to Akamai Web Application Firewall (WAF). They can be exploited only locally, or are a non-HTTP vulnerability.
      - `INSUFFICIENT_EXPLOIT_INFO`: Our threat research team didn't find any exploit for these CVEs.

      Note: Your rules need to be set to `DENY` to protect against a CVE. Rules set to `ALERT` or `NONE` still allow traffic through even when the rule recognizes a threat from a CVE.
    enum:
    - WAF
    - LOCAL_VULNERABILITY
    - INSUFFICIENT_EXPLOIT_INFO
    - NON_HTTP
    - CUSTOM_RULE
