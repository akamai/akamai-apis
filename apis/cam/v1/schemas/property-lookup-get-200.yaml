      The status of the property lookup process. The values come from the Property Manager API. `SUBMITTED` indicates the lookup request was sent.  `PENDING` indicates the request is in a queue to process.  `IN_PROGRESS` indicates Akamai received the lookup request and it's being processed. `COMPLETE` indicates the lookup is finished and the response includes property-specific data.  For any `ERROR`, try the [property lookup request](ref:get-property-lookup) again.
    enum:
    - COMPLETE
    - ERROR
    - IN_PROGRESS
    - PENDING
    - SUBMITTED
