      Status indicating whether the version has been activated to the Akamai networks. `PENDING_ACTIVATION` indicates that Akamai has received the request and a new version is in process. If `ACTIVE`, you can enable the version in the [Origin Characteristics](doc:usage-examples#create-and-apply-an-access-key) behavior when configuring your property to support CAM. Once an access key has been created, it's available on both the staging and production Akamai networks. When an access key is activated, it is activated on both the staging and production Akamai networks. `PENDING_DELETION` indicates Akamai has received a request to [delete](ref:delete-access-key-version) the version and the system is processing it.
