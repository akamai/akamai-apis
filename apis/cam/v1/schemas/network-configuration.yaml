      You can deploy the access key to these additional networks. Use `CHINA_CDN` to make the access key available in Akamai's China CDN. Use `RUSSIA_CDN` to make the access key available in Akamai's Russia CDN. `null` indicates no CDN has been selected. If the `securityNetwork` is `STANDARD_TLS`, RUSSIA_CDN is included by default. If it's `ENHANCED_TLS`, each network needs to be added manually to access these CDNs.

      The API deploys the access key to this secure network. `STANDARD_TLS` deploys the access key to Akamai's standard secure network, which is [non-PCI compliant](doc:concepts). `Enhanced TLS` deploys the access key to Akamai's enhanced secure network which is [PCI compliant](doc:concepts).
