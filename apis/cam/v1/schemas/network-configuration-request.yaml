      Additional type of the deployment network that the access key will be deployed to. Include `CHINA_CDN` to make the access key available in Akamai's China CDN. Include `RUSSIA_CDN` to make the access key available in Akamai's Russia CDN. If you're using a Standard TLS certificate for security, RUSSIA_CDN is included by default, so you don't need to include it here. If you're using an Enhanced TLS certificate, you'll need to include both to access these CDNs.

    - CHINA_CDN
    - RUSSIA_CDN

      The API deploys the access key to this secure network. `STANDARD_TLS` deploys the access key to Akamai's standard secure network. This is [non-PCI compliant](doc:concepts). `ENHANCED_TLS` deploys the access key to Akamai's more secure network which is [PCI compliant](doc:concepts).
    enum:
    - ENHANCED_TLS
    - STANDARD_TLS
