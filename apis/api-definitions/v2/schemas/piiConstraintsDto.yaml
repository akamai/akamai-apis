      The extent to which the network should inspect your API and enforce constraints you set. Use `NONE` to let all traffic though as if PII discovery is disabled. Use `API` to inspect and enforce constraints for every resource and method in your API. Use `RESOURCES_AND_METHODS` to inspect specific resources and methods within your API.
