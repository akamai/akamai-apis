  The preference for selecting the endpoint version to return. By default the API returns the `LAST_UPDATED` version. If you set the preference to `ACTIVATED_FIRST`, the API first attempts to return the version currently active on the production network. If such version doesn't exist, the API attempts to return the version currently active on the staging network. If both of these checks fail, the API returns the last updated version.
