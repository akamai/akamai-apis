  The type of endpoints to return based on their visibility status. By default the API returns `ALL` endpoints. You can instead decide to return `ONLY_VISIBLE` endpoints, or `ONLY_HIDDEN` endpoints. Run the [Show an endpoint](ref:post-endpoint-show) and [Hide an endpoint](ref:post-endpoint-hide) operations to control which endpoints are listed.
