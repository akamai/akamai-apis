  The type of endpoint versions to return based on their visibility status. By default the API returns `ALL` endpoint version. You can instead decide to return `ONLY_VISIBLE` endpoint versions, or `ONLY_HIDDEN` endpoint versions. Run the [Show a version](ref:post-version-show) and [Hide a version](ref:post-endpoint-version-hide) operations to control which endpoint versions are listed.
