The response objects encapsulate pairings of contract and group identifiers available within the scope of the user who provisioned the API token, as described in [Get started](ref:api-get-started).

        Lists all hostnames through which API consumers can access an endpoint service under a given contract and group pairing. Returns each hostname together with the access control group where the hostname is registered.
