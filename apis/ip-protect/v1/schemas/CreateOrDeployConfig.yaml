                  Specifies the source IP for network packets received at a customer's back-end server or subnet. By default, packets are set to `NA`, identifying Akamai as the source IP. Other source IP options are `NAT46`, `CIP`, `PROXY_PROTOCOL_V1`, `PROXY_PROTOCOL_V2`, and `OPTION_28`. `NAT46` is only available if the virtual IP address has an IPv4 address and the back-end server or subnet has an IPv6 address. The remaining options require the virtual IP address to be running on a TCP network.
                enum:
                - CIP
                - PROXY_PROTOCOL_V1
                - PROXY_PROTOCOL_V2
                - OPTION_28
                - NAT46
                - NA
