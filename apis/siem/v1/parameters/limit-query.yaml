description: |-
  Defines the approximate maximum number of security events each fetch returns, in both offset and time-based modes. The default limit is `10000` and the maximum limit available is `600000`. Listing an unlimited number of logs isn't possible. Expect requests to return a slightly higher number of security events than you set in the `limit` parameter, because data is stored in different buckets.
