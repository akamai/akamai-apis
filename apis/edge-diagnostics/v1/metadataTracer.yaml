      description: |
        Launches an [asynchronous](ref:asynchronous-processes) request to trace metadata for a URL configured in Property Manager. The metadata tracing works for the current property version active either on staging or production. To run the operation for a location, run the [List available locations for metadata tracing](ref:get-mdt-locations) operation first to get available values. If you don't provide a location ID or an edge server IP, then Edge Diagnostics runs the operation using a random location.

        Lists active locations you can use to run the [Launch a metadata tracing request](ref:post-mdt) operation together with information about supported HTTP methods. The operation responds with a subset of edge servers returned by the [List available edge server locations](ref:get-edge-locations) operation.

        Returns the status of the [asynchronous](ref:asynchronous-processes) [Launch a Metadata Tracer request](ref:post-mdt) operation.
