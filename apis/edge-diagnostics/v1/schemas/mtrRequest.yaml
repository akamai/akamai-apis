  destination:
    type: string
    description: |
      MTR destination compliant with the `destinationType`, either a hostname or a destination IP. To build an object for a GTM hostname, enter the `target` value returned by the [List test and target IPs for a GTM hostname](ref:get-gtm-property-domain-gtm-property-ips) operation. For a Site Shield hostname, enter a destination IP address.
    minLength: 1
  destinationType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Type of destination input, either `IP` or `HOST`. To build an object for a GTM or Site Shield hostname, choose `IP`.
    enum:
    - IP
    - HOST
  packetType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Packet type used by MTR, either `ICMP` or `TCP`.
    enum:
    - ICMP
    - TCP
  port:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Port to use to run MTR, either `80` or `443`. Provide it only for `destinationType` set to `HOST`.
    enum:
    - 80
    - 443
  resolveDns:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Resolves DNS for each hop.
  showIps:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Shows IPs for each hop.
  showLocations:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Shows locations for each hop.
  siteShieldHostname:
    type: string
    description: |
      Site Shield hostname you want to run the MTR for.
    format: hostname
  source:
    type: string
    description: |
      MTR source compliant with the `sourceType`, either an edge server IP or a location. For locations, enter `edgeLocationId` for an edge server location closest to your end users. To get this value, run the [List available edge server locations](ref:get-edge-locations) operation first. For edge IPs, use the edge server IP value from the `answerSection` array in the [Get domain details with dig](ref:post-dig) operation response. To build an object for a GTM hostname, enter the `testIp` value returned by the [List test and target IPs for a GTM hostname](ref:get-gtm-property-domain-gtm-property-ips) operation.
    minLength: 1
  sourceType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Type of the source input, either `EDGE_IP` or `LOCATION`. To build an object for a GTM hostname, choose `EDGE_IP`.
    enum:
    - EDGE_IP
    - LOCATION
