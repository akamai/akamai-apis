      description: |
        Requests content using the `curl` command to provide the raw HTML for a URL, including request headers. You can run this operation for a specific location, an edge server IP, or a Site Shield map. If you want to get the data for a location, you need to run the [List available edge server locations](ref:get-edge-locations) operation first to get `edgeLocationId`. And if you want to run this operation for an IP,  you may need to [verify an IP](ref:post-verify-edge-ip) to check if it belongs to an edge server. If you provide neither a location nor an edge server IP, then Edge Diagnostics runs the operation using a random edge server IP.
