        Launches an [asynchronous](ref:asynchronous-processes) request to simultaneously run [Launch a GREP request](ref:post-grep), [Request content with cURL](ref:post-curl), and [Test network connectivity with MTR](ref:post-mtr) operations for a URL. It may help you diagnose issues with slow download and high response time. Successful operations return fetched GREP, cURL, and MTR data.
