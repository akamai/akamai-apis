        Invalidates content on the selected CP code for the selected `network`. You should consider invalidating content by default. This keeps each object in cache until the version on your origin server is newer. Deletion retrieves the object regardless, which can dramatically increase the load on your origin server and would prevent Akamai from serving the old content if your origin is unreachable.
