      Indicates the status of the edge hostname. `READY` means that you can use the edge hostname to deploy a property hostname in China. `NOT_READY` means the edge hostname isn't configured properly. For example, the edge hostname doesn't have a product ID specified. In this case, the API can't use the edge hostname until you resolve the issue. [Learn more](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edge-hostnames/reference/get-edgehostnameid). `NOT_SUPPORTED` means the API doesn't automatically manage mapping or unmapping for the DNS zone of the edge hostname. A `null` value means the edge hostname isn't needed for the provision state change. For example, if you're only whitelisting your property hostname.
