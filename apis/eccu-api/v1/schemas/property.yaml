      Specifies the type of digital property. Either `ARL_TOKEN` or `HOST_HEADER`. This tells the edge network whether the purge information is contained in the ARL, or in a configuration file. The ARL is similar to the URL, but the ARL is specifically defined for objects to be served by the edge network. There are two types of ARLs, v1 and v2. For details, see the [Purge Cache documentation](https://techdocs.akamai.com/purge-cache/docs/digital-props).
    enum:
    - ARL_TOKEN
    - HOST_HEADER
