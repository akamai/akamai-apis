required:
- datacenterId
properties:
  city:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the city where the data center is located.
    nullable: true
  cloneOf:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Identifies the data center's `datacenterId` of which this data center is a clone. A data center clone is just like any other data center except that it inherits its geographic attributes `continent`, `country`, `stateOrProvince`, `city`, `latitude`, and `longitude` from the data center of which it is a clone.
    nullable: true
  cloudServerHostHeaderOverride:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Balances load between two or more servers in a cloud environment. Either `true` if cloud server targeting is enabled or `false` if not.
  cloudServerTargeting:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Balances load between two or more servers in a cloud environment. Either `true` if cloud server targeting is enabled or `false` if not.
  continent:
    type: string
    description: |
      A two-letter code that specifies the continent where the data center maps to. If omitted, GTM populates this member. Either `AF`, `AS`, `EU`, `NA`, `OC`, `OT`, or `SA`.
    nullable: true
    enum:
    - AF
    - AS
    - EU
    - NA
    - OC
    - OT
    - SA
    maxLength: 2
  country:
    type: string
    description: |
      A two-letter [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country code that specifies the country where the data center maps to.
    nullable: true
    maxLength: 2
  datacenterId:
    type: integer
    description: |
      A unique identifier for an existing data center in the domain.
  defaultLoadObject:
    type: object
    description: |
      Specifies the load reporting interface between you and the GTM system. A load object is a file that provides real-time information about the current load, maximum allowable load, and target load on each resource. This default load object is intended to be shared. Individual Resources can specify `useDefaultLoadObject` to use it instead of specifying their own.
    additionalProperties: false
    properties:
      loadObject:
        type: string
        description: |
          Specifies the load object that GTM requests. A load object is a file that provides real-time information about the current load, maximum allowable load, and target load on each resource. The value cannot begin with a `:` character, and is limited to a maximum of 256 characters.
        nullable: true
        maxLength: 256
        pattern: ^(?!:).*$
      loadObjectPort:
        type: integer
        description: |
          Specifies the TCP port to connect to when requesting the load object. A value of `0` means to use the default port, equivalent to either `80` or `443`.
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 65535
      loadServers:
        type: array
        description: |
          Specifies a list of servers to request the load object from. The value needs to contain IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, or DNS names that contain A or AAAA records. If a DNS name has both A and AAAA records, then GTM picks one randomly. For IP addresses, don't use non-routable [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) addresses.
        nullable: true
        items:
          type: string
          maxLength: 256
  latitude:
    type: number
    description: |
      Specifies the geographical latitude of the data center's position. See also `longitude` within this object.
  links:
    type: array
    description: |
      Provides a URL path that allows direct navigation to a data center.
    items:
      $ref: link.yaml
  longitude:
    type: number
    description: |
      Specifies the geographic longitude of the data center's position. See also `latitude` within this object.
  nickname:
    type: string
    description: |
      A descriptive label for the data center.
    maxLength: 256
  scorePenalty:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Influences the score for a datacenter. Giving a positive penalty increases the score and drives traffic away from the datacenter. Giving a negative penalty reduces the score and draws in more traffic  that would otherwise go elsewhere. As the score is measured in milliseconds of ping time, very small numbers like 1 or 2 have virtually no effect. Typically, penalties are given in the tens or hundreds. Note that `scorePenalty` applies only for properties that use performance load balancing.
  stateOrProvince:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies a two-letter [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) country code for the state or province where the data center is located.
    nullable: true
  virtual:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether or not the data center is `virtual` or physical, the latter meaning the data center has an Akamai Network Agent installed, and its physical location in latitude and longitude is fixed. Either `true` if `virtual` or `false` if physical.
    readOnly: true
