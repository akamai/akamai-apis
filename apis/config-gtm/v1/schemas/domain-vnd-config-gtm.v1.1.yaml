      The full GTM domain name that needs to end in `.akadns.net`, up to 100 characters.
    minLength: 1
    maxLength: 100
  type:
    type: string
    description: |
      Indicates the type of domain available based on your contract. Either `failover-only`, `static`, `weighted`, `basic`, or `full`.
    enum:
    - failover-only
    - static
    - weighted
    - basic
    - full
  properties:
    type: array
    description: |
      Contains information about the properties in the GTM domain.
    items:
      $ref: property-vnd-config-gtm.v1.1.yaml
  asMaps:
    type: array
    description: |
      Contains information about the set of AS maps assigned to this domain.
    items:
      $ref: as-map.yaml
  cidrMaps:
    type: array
    description: |
      Contains information about the set of CIDR maps assigned to this domain.
    items:
      $ref: cidr-dto.yaml
  cnameCoalescingEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If enabled, GTM collapses CNAME redirections in DNS answers when it knows the target of the CNAME. The default value is `false`.
  datacenters:
    type: array
    description: |
      Contains information about the set of data centers assigned to this domain.
    items:
      $ref: datacenter-vnd-config-gtm.v1.1.yaml
  defaultErrorPenalty:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Specifies the download penalty score. If the download encounters an error, the web agent computes a score that is either the download time in seconds or a penalty score. The default penalty is `75`.
  defaultSslClientCertificate:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies an optional Base64-encoded certificate that corresponds with the private key for TLS-based liveness tests (HTTPS, SMTPS, POPS, and TCPS). When the liveness test does not contain `sslClientCertificate` and `sslClientPrivateKey` values, use this and the `defaultSslClientPrivateKey` object members to generate a certificate. In this case, use a separate, throwaway private key when generating a certificate or certificate signing request (CSR). You shouldn't use this key for any other purpose. See also `defaultSslClientPrivateKey` within this object.
    nullable: true
  defaultSslClientPrivateKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies an optional Base64-encoded private key that corresponds with the TLS certificate for TLS-based liveness tests (HTTPS, SMTPS, POPS, and TCPS). See also `defaultSslClientCertificate` within this object.
    nullable: true
  defaultTimeoutPenalty:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Specifies the timeout penalty score. The web agent then computes a score that is either the download time in seconds or a penalty score if the download request times out. The default penalty for a time out is `25`.
  emailNotificationList:
    type: array
    description: |
      A list of email addresses to notify when a change is made to the domain.
    items:
      type: string
      format: email
  geographicMaps:
    type: array
    description: |
      Contains information about the set of geographic maps assigned to this domain.
    items:
      $ref: geographic-map.yaml
  lastModified:
    type: string
    description: |
      An ISO 8601 timestamp that indicates the time of the last domain change.
    format: date-time
  lastModifiedBy:
    type: string
    description: |
      The email address of the administrator who made the last change to the domain.
    nullable: true
    maxLength: 256
  links:
    type: array
    description: |
      Provides a URL path that allows direct navigation to the domain.
    items:
      $ref: link.yaml
  loadFeedback:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether you're using `resources` to control load balancing.  Resources represent a constraint on how much load a data center can absorb. The value is `true` if you're using load feedback.
  loadImbalancePercentage:
    type: number
    description: |
      Indicates the percent of load imbalance factor (LIF) for the domain. It lets GTM exceed the value configured for traffic distribution. For example, if the data center's traffic allocation is 25 percent and the LIF is 1.5, the demand can grow to 37.5 percent (25% &times; 1.5) before the load balancer starts shifting load away from it. If the LIF is `0`, no load imbalance is allowed. However, internally, GTM adds one to the LIF to allow its use as a multiplier. The default LIF is 1.1, which is displayed as `10.0` percent. The value ranges from `0` to `1000000` percent.
    nullable: true
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 1000000
  modificationComments:
    type: string
    description: |
      A descriptive note about changes to the domain. The maximum is 4000 characters.
    nullable: true
    maxLength: 4000
  resources:
    type: array
    description: |
      Contains information about the resources in the GTM domain.
    items:
      $ref: resource.yaml
  status:
    description: |
      Specifies the condition of the change in the domain's activation.
