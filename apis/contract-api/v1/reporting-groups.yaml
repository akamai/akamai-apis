        Get the IDs and names of the products associated with the reporting group for the time frame selected. To run this operation, your user account needs the CPCode Rep Group role. To add this role, use the [Identity and Access Management application](https://control.akamai.com/admin/?tab=CONFIGURE&type=context). When a request is successful, it may return either a 200 or a 300 response. The API returns a 200 (OK) response when the CP code reporting group is associated with only one contract. You'll receive a `300 Multiple Choices` response when the request returns a list of matching contracts because the CP code reporting group is associated with multiple contracts. To retrieve product information when you receive a 300 response code, make a new GET request to the hyperlinks provided in the response.
