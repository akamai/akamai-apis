  Limits data to the type of traffic, `non-secure` for HTTP traffic, `secure-shared` for standard secure (HTTPS) traffic using the Akamai "shared certificate, `secure-standard` for Standard TLS HTTPS traffic, `secure-premium` for Enhanced TLS HTTPS traffic, or the default `all`. Older options are still supported including, `http` for non-secure traffic, `ssl` for secure shared-certificate traffic, and `essl` for secure customer-certificate traffic. However, it's best to use the newer options.
