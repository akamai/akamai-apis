        Data stores are collections of reporting dimensions and the individual metrics supported for use with those dimensions. Each data store is unique to its delivery product. For example, you can't combine HTTP Downloads/File Downloads' dimensions and metrics with those from another product in this API. This operation's response can be very long, so the example here is truncated.
