    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable to delete the previous HTTP digest authentication settings. This will only take effect if multiple keys are active.
  algorithm:
    type: string
    description: |
      The algorithm used to generate the hash for authentication. Specify `SHA256`, `SHA512`, `SHA512_256`, or `MD5`. `SHA256` is the Secure Hash Algorithm, which is a type of cryptographic hash function that generates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash. A cryptographic hash is like a signature for a text or a data file. `SHA512` is a cryptographic hash function that when applied to the provided input results in a 128-digit hexadecimal number that is highly unlikely to match the value produced for a different input. The `MD5` message-digest algorithm is a hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. It is less secure than `SHA256`.
    enum:
    - SHA256
    - SHA512
    - MD5
    - SHA512_256

    type: string
    description: |
      Specify the password for authentication.
  username:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specify the username for authentication.
