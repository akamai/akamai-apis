  Provides details about the Oracle Cloud Storage destination in a stream. When validating this destination, DataStream uses the provided `accessKey` and `secretAccessKey` values and tries to save an `Akamai_access_verification_[TimeStamp].txt file in your Oracle Cloud Storage folder. You can only see this file if the validation process is successful, and you have access to the Oracle Cloud Storage bucket and folder that you're trying to send logs to.
