  Provides detailed information about the Splunk destination that you can use in your stream. Note that DataStream 2 currently supports only endpoint URLs ending with `collector/raw`. If you choose this destination, the stream pushes a sample POST request to the endpoint to validate write access. For `STRUCTURED` logs, the data is sent as `0,access_validation`, and for `JSON` it's `{"access_validation":true}`. You can see the data only if the destination validates, and you can access the destination storage.

  mTlsEnabled:
    type: boolean
