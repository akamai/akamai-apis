type: object
description: |-
  Provides detailed information about the Splunk destination that you can use in your stream. Note that DataStream 2 currently supports only endpoint URLs ending with `collector/raw`. If you choose this destination, the stream pushes a sample POST request to the endpoint to validate write access. For `STRUCTURED` logs, the data is sent as `0,access_validation`, and for `JSON` it's `{"access_validation":true}`. You can see the data only if the destination validates, and you can access the destination storage.

properties:
  caCert:
    type: string
    description: |
      The certification authority (CA) certificate used to verify the origin server's certificate. If the certificate is not signed by a well-known certification authority, enter the CA certificate in the PEM format for verification. If you set this member, the `mTlsEnabled` property replaces it in the response as `true`.
  clientCert:
    type: string
    description: |
      The digital certificate in the PEM format that authenticates requests to your destination. If you want to use mutual authentication, you need to provide both the client certificate and the client key.
  clientKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      The private key in the non-encrypted PKCS8 format that authenticates with the back-end server. If you want to use mutual authentication, you need to provide both the client certificate and the client key.
  compressLogs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables gzip compression for a log file sent to a destination. If not set, this member's value is `true `by default.

    description: |
      A human-readable name for the request's custom header, containing only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters. For details, see the additional options discussed in [Additional options](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/v2/docs/stream-splunk#additional-options).
  customHeaderValue:
    type: string
    description: |
      The custom header's contents passed with the request that contains information about the client connection. For details, see the additional options discussed in [Additional options](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/v2/docs/stream-splunk#additional-options).
  destinationType:
    type: string

  displayName:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the destination.
  endpoint:
    type: string
    description: |
      The raw event Splunk URL where you want to store your logs. You can use Akamaized property hostnames as endpoint URLs. See [Stream logs to Splunk](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/v2/docs/stream-splunk#akamaized-hostname-as-endpoint).
  eventCollectorToken:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Event Collector token for your Splunk account. See [View usage of Event Collector token](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.0.3/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) in the Splunk documentation.
  tlsHostname:
    type: string
    description: |
      The hostname that verifies the server's certificate and matches the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in the certificate. If not provided, DataStream fetches the hostname from the endpoint URL.
