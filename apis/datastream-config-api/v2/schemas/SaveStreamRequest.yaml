      Identifies the properties that belong to the same product and you want to monitor in the stream. Note that a stream can only log data for active properties. You can [activate a property](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#postpropertyactivations) in Property Manager.

  collectMidgress:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to `true` to collect midgress traffic data within the Akamai platform, such as between two edge servers. Enable logging midgress data to get numeric values in the second place of the log line that indicate if the request was processed within the Akamai platform. When you [Get a stream](ref:get-stream) that logs midgress traffic, the response returns `collectMidgress` as `true` and lists the `isMidgress` data set field with other fields. See [Midgress traffic](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/v2/docs/data-set-parameters#midgress-traffic) for details. If this feature is not enabled on your account, contact the Akamai support team.
