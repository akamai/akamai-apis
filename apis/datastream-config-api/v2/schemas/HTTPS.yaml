  Provides detailed information about the custom HTTPS endpoint you can use as a destination for a stream. This includes basic or no authentication, and whether the stream sends uncompressed or gzip-compressed log files. If you choose this destination, the stream pushes a sample POST request to the endpoint to validate write access. For `STRUCTURED` logs, the data is sent as `0,access_validation`, and for `JSON` it's `{"access_validation":true}`. You can see the data only if the destination validates, and you can access the destination storage.

  authenticationType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Either `NONE` for no authentication, or `BASIC`. For basic authentication, provide the username and password you set in your custom HTTPS endpoint.

    - BASIC
    - NONE
  caCert:
    type: string
    description: |
      The certification authority (CA) certificate used to verify the origin server's certificate. If the certificate is not signed by a well-known certification authority, enter the CA certificate in the PEM format for verification. If you set this member, the `mTlsEnabled` property replaces it in the response as `true`.
  clientCert:
    type: string
    description: |
      The PEM-formatted digital certificate you want to authenticate requests to your destination with. If you want to use mutual authentication, you need to provide both the client certificate and the client key. If you pass this member, the `mTlsEnabled` member replaces it in the response as `true`.
  clientKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      The private key in the non-encrypted PKCS8 format that authenticates with the back-end server. If you want to use mutual authentication, you need to provide both the client certificate and the client key.
  compressLogs:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enables gzip compression for a log file sent to a destination. This member's value is `false` by default.
    default: false

  customHeaderName:
    type: string
    description: |
      A human-readable name for the request's custom header, containing only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters. For details, see the additional options discussed in [Stream logs to a HTTPS endpoint](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/v2/docs/stream-custom-https#additional-options).
  customHeaderValue:
    type: string
    description: |
      The custom header's contents passed with the request that contains information about the client connection. For details, see the additional options discussed in [Stream logs to a HTTPS endpoint](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/v2/docs/stream-custom-https#additional-options).

      The name of the destination.
  endpoint:
    type: string
    description: |
      Enter the secure URL where you want to send and store your logs. You can use Akamaized property hostnames as endpoint URLs. See [Stream logs to a custom HTTPS endpoint](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/v2/docs/stream-custom-https#akamaized-hostname-as-endpoint).
  password:
    type: string
    description: |
      Enter the password you set in your custom HTTPS endpoint for authentication.
  tlsHostname:
    type: string
