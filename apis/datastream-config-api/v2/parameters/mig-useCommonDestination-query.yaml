name: useCommonDestination
in: query
description: |-
  Configures a single destination across all migrated streams. The default `false` value returns the response payload with a `destinations` array with destinations for each stream separately. Set this parameter to `true` to get the response payload with a `commonDestinations` array listing the destinations for all DataStream 1 streams you provide in the request. The [Migrate streams](ref:migrate-stream) operation requires at least one destination per stream in the `destinations` or `commonDestinations` array.
