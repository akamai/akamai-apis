  Provides detailed information about the Google Cloud Storage connector you can use in a stream. When validating this connector, DataStream uses the private access key to create an `Akamai_access_verification_<timestamp>.txt` object file in your GCS bucket. You can only see this file if the validation process is successful, and you have access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket where you are trying to send logs.
