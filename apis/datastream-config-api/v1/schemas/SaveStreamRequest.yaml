  activateNow:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether to start activating the stream on request. Either `true` for activating the stream upon sending the request or `false` for leaving the stream inactive after the request. If not set, this member's value is `true` by default. When editing an inactive or deactivated stream, set this member to `true` to activate the stream upon the request. For active streams, the value is ignored and the new version becomes active by default. You can activate or deactivate the stream at your convenience by running the [Activate a stream](ref:activate-stream) or [Deactivate a stream](ref:deactivate-stream) operations.
  collectMidgress:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to `true` to collect midgress traffic data within the Akamai platform, such as between two edge servers. Enable logging midgress data to get numeric values in the second place of the log line that indicate if the request was processed within the Akamai platform. When you [Get a stream](ref:get-stream) that logs midgress traffic, the response returns `collectMidgress` as `true` and lists the `isMidgress` data set field with other fields. See [Midgress traffic](doc:data-set-parameters#midgress-traffic) for details. If this feature is not enabled on your account, contact the Akamai support team.

      format:
        type: string
        description: |
          The format in which you want to receive log files. `STRUCTURED` or `JSON` are the currently available formats. When the delimiter is present in the request, `STRUCTURED` is the mandatory format.

        - STRUCTURED
        - JSON
      delimiter:
        type: string
        description: |
          A delimiter that you want to use to separate data set fields in the log lines. `SPACE` is the only available delimiter at this time. This field is required only for the STRUCTURED log file format.

        - SPACE
      frequency:

        description: |
          The prefix of the log file that you want to send to a destination. It's a string of at most 200 characters. If unspecified, it defaults to `ak`. This member supports [Dynamic time variables](doc:dynamic-time-variables), but doesn't support the `.` character. See [S3 naming conventions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html), [Azure blob naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#:%7E:text=Blob%20Names&text=A%20blob%20name%20can%20contain,up%20to%20256%20characters%20long), and [Google Cloud Storage object naming conventions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming-objects).
