type: object
description: |-
  Provides detailed information about the Splunk connector that you can use in your stream. The stream pushes a sample POST request to the endpoint to validate write access. For `STRUCTURED` logs, the data is sent as `0,access_validation`, and for `JSON` it's `{"access_validation":true}`. You can see the data only if the destination validates, and you can access the destination storage.

  clientKey:
    type: string
    description: |
      The private key in the non-encrypted PKCS8 format you want to use to authenticate with the back-end server. If you want to use mutual authentication, you need to provide both the client certificate and the client key.

  tlsHostname:
    type: string
    description: |
      The hostname that verifies the server's certificate and matches the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in the certificate. If not provided, DataStream fetches the hostname from the endpoint URL.
