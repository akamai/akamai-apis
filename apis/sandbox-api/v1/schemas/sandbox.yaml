  A sandbox is an isolated development environment used for testing. Each sandbox has a unique identifier, or `sandboxId`. If you create a sandbox with `isClonable` enabled, another developer can quickly create a sandbox with the same configuration settings. When you create a sandbox, give it a meaningful `name`.
