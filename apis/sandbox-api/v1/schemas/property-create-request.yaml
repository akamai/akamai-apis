properties:
  contractId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The identifier you can use to create a sandbox from a specific contract. If you use this, you also need to specify the `groupId`.
  cpcode:
    type: number
    description: |
      Unique code that enables you to isolate sandbox traffic in report data. If you do not specify a value, the system creates one.
  edgeHostname:
    type: string
    description: |
      The edge hostname for the property as configured in Property Manager. May be specified instead of `propertyId`, `hostname`, or `propertyName`.
  groupId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The identifier you can use to create a sandbox from a specific group. If you use this, you also need to specify the `contractId`.
  hostname:
    type: string
    description: |
      The hostname for the property as configured in Property Manager. May be specified instead of `propertyId`, `edgeHostname`, or `propertyName`.
  propertyId:
    type: string

      The unique identifier for the property as it appears in Property Manager. May be specified instead of `hostname`, `edgeHostname`, or `propertyName`.
  propertyName:
    type: string

  propertyVersion:
    type: number
    description: |
      If not specified, the API uses the version that is active in production. If an active version is not found, the API uses the most recent version.
  requestHostnames:
    type: array
    description: |
      Specifies the hostnames for the request. If you try to create a sandbox property with a `requestHostname` that is not already contained in the property configuration, you may get unexpected results. The Sandbox API automatically converts any specified request hostnames to lower case.

      type: string
  ruleFormat:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies the rule format. The rule format is a dated version of the rule object in a property configuration. For more information, refer to the [Property Manager API](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#understandingruleformats).
  rules:
    type: object
    description: |
      Defines how your website and applications process requests and the behaviors to apply to those requests. Include a `rules` object if you want to apply specific rules to test within your sandbox. The content-handling rules are defined in the [Property Manager API](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/reference/rule-trees).
