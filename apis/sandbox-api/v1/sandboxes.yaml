      tags:
      - Sandboxes
      description: |
        You can create a sandbox based on an existing `property`, `hostname`, or property `version`. Refer to the example JSONs for each use case in the [Recipes](https://techdocs.akamai.com/sandbox/recipes). In order to create a sandbox with this method, you need to have an API client for the `Sandbox API` with read-write access and Property Manager authorization enabled in Control Center.

      description: |
        This operation returns a list of sandboxes. In the response object, you can see the `sandboxId`, the developer who created the sandbox, and the sandbox `name`. The `X-Limit-Sandboxes-Remaining` in the response header indicates the number of remaining sandboxes you can create. Generally, you will only see a list of sandboxes you created. If your Control Center user role has permission to edit Property Manager configurations, you have access to view all the sandboxes within the account. You'll be able to [Delete a sandbox](ref:delete-sandbox) returned in the list. You will only be able to [Update a rule tree](ref:put-sandbox-properties-rules) if your user role has permission to edit the property within your Property Manager configuration. For more information on user roles and permissions, refer to [Identity and Access Management](https://techdocs.akamai.com/iam/docs/welcome-id-access-mgmt).
