        Creates an empty key collection. To upload public keys to a newly created collection, run the [Create a key collection version](ref:post-key-collection-version) operation. Also, store the `id` of the key collection for when you want to start referring to this collection in the JWT behavior of your property. See [API concepts](ref:api-concepts).

        Creates a version of the key collection. This lets you provide primary and secondary public keys to verify JWTs passed in client requests. If you don't already have the `collectionId`, run the [Get a collection](ref:get-key-collections) operation and use the appropriate `id` value from the returned array. Also, to start using the public keys on staging or production, run the [Activate this key collection version](ref:post-activation) operation.
