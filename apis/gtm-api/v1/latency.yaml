        This operation returns a collection of reports representing latency and loss of ping data as reported by network agents in each Data Center for a property. Latency and Loss parameters follow bucket ranges schema (bucket ranges, delimited by a pipe: `|`).

        Ping Loss ranges from `0%` to `100%`. So a schema of `5|10|15|20` would represent grouping of data from `0%` to `5%`, `5%` to `10%`, `10%` to `15%`, `15%` to `20%`, and `20%` to `100%` bucket ranges. The end of one bucket would be the beginning of the next bucket. Similarly `0|5|80` would represent `0%`, `0%` to `5%`, `5%` to `100%`, and `80%` to `100%` bucket ranges. A trailing pipe at the end of a bucket indicates that there is no _greater than the max_ bucket, i.e. in the above example if loss schema was `0|5|80|` then it would mean `0%`, `0%` to `5%`, and `5%` to `80%`.

        Latency is measured in milliseconds. Each bucket ranges from 0 ms to 1000 ms.  So, a schema of `5|10|300|1000` would mean `0ms` to `5ms`, `5ms` to `10ms`, `10ms` to `300ms`, `300ms` to `1000ms`, and `> 1000ms`.
