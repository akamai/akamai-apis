      Identifies the type of alert the template enables, either `STATIC` or `ADAPTIVE`. Static alert types specify raw values, while the adaptive alert type expresses standard deviations. The only available `ADAPTIVE` alert identifies excessive traffic, and its `templateId` is `a@1`.
    enum:
    - STATIC
    - ADAPTIVE
