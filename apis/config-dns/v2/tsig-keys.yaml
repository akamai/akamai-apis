      description: |
        This updates the key data for multiple zones at once. Keep in mind that this operation can only add zones to a TSIG key, not remove them. To safely remove the association between a zone and a TSIG key, update the zone to its new TSIG key or remove the key from the zone if you're sure it's no longer needed.
