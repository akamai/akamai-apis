  - Zone transfer status
  description: |
    Returns the results of the most recent zone transfer attempts for one or more zones.  When you configure a `SECONDARY` zone, several Akamai name servers known as zone transfer agents perform zone transfer requests to fetch the record data from the zone's configured master name servers. The data returned by this operation describes the results of those zone transfers.
