  Emphasizes edges and details in source images without distorting the colors. Although this effect is often referred to as _sharpening_ an image, it actually creates a blurred, inverted copy of the image known as an unsharp mask. Image & Video Manager combines the unsharp mask with the source image to create an image perceived as clearer.
