      Provides a reason for an Image & Video Manager failure. The possible values are: `DURATION` when the pristine video exceeds the maximum duration of 5 minutes, `BYTES` when the pristine video exceeds the maximum size of 256 MB, `PIXEL` when the pristine video pixels exceed 3,686,400 (1920&times;1920), `SAMPLERATE` when the pristine video exceeds maximum sample rate of 60 Hz, `UNPARSEABLE` when the pristine video isn't a recognized or supported video format, `PRISTINE_TOO_WIDE` when the pristine image width exceeds 9999 pixels, `PRISTINE_TOO_TALL` when the pristine image height exceeds 9999 pixels, `PROCESS_FAILED_INTERNALLY` when the image or video couldn't be fetched from the origin or the policy is outdated, or `INVALID_POLICY` when the policy parameters are invalid.
    enum:
    - DURATION
    - BYTES
    - PIXEL
    - SAMPLERATE
    - UNPARSEABLE

    type: integer
    description: |
      The threshold value of the metric mentioned in the reason.
  transformationType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The type of transformation requested. The transformation type is `OFFLINE` if the image processing is queued for offline processing, or `REALTIME` if the image processing is performed in realtime.
    enum:
    - REALTIME
    - OFFLINE
  url:
    type: string
