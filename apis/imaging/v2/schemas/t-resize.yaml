  Resizes an image to a particular, absolute dimension. If you don't enter a `width` or a `height`, the image is resized with the `fit` aspect preservation mode, which selects a value for the missing dimension that preserves the image's aspect.

      Sets constraints for the image resize. Select `normal` to resize in all cases, either increasing or decreasing the dimensions. Select `downsize` to ignore this transformation if the result would be larger than the original. Select `upsize` to ignore this transformation if the result would be smaller.

      Preserves the aspect ratio. Select `fit` to make the image fit entirely within the selected width and height. When using `fit`, the resulting image has the largest possible size for the specified dimensions. Select `fill` to size the image so it both completely fills the dimensions and has the smallest possible file size. Otherwise `ignore` changes the original aspect ratio to fit within an arbitrarily shaped rectangle.
