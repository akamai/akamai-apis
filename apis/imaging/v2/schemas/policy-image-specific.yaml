      Dictates the output quality, either `quality` or `perceptualQuality`, and the formats created for each resized image. If unspecified, you get image formats that support all browsers at the default quality level of `85`, including WEBP, JPEG2000, and JPEG-XR for specific browsers.

          Overrides the quality of the image to serve when Image & Video Manager detects a slow connection with a round-trip time (RTT) of less than 300 ms. Specifying lower values lets users with slow connections browse your site with reduced load times without impacting the quality of images for users with standard connections.

      perceptualQuality:
        description: |
          Mutually exclusive with `quality`. The perceptual quality to use when comparing resulting images, which overrides the `quality` setting. Perceptual quality tunes each image format's quality dynamically based on the human-perceived quality of the output image. This can result in greater byte savings as compared to using regular `quality` because many images can be encoded at a much lower quality without compromising the perceived quality of the image. In addition, certain images may need to be encoded at a slightly higher quality in order to maintain human-perceived quality. Value tiers are `high`, `mediumHigh`, `medium`, `mediumLow`, and `low`.
