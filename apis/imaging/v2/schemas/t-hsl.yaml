  Adjusts the hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) of an image. Hue is the number of degrees that colors rotate around the color wheel. Saturation is a multiplier to increase or decrease color saturation. Lightness is a multiplier to increase or decrease the lightness of an image. Other transformations can also affect color, such as `Grayscale` and `MaxColors`. If you're using more than one, consider the order to apply them for the desired results.

  lightness:
    description: |
      A multiplier to adjust the lightness of colors in the image. Note that lightness is distinct from brightness. For example, reducing the lightness of a light green might give you a lime green, whereas reducing the brightness of a light green might give you a darker shade of the same green. Values less than `1.0` decrease the lightness of colors in the image. Values greater than `1.0` increase the lightness of colors in the image.

  saturation:
    description: |
      A multiplier to adjust the saturation of colors in the image. Values less than `1.0` decrease saturation and values greater than `1.0` increase the saturation. A value of `0.0` removes all color from the image.
