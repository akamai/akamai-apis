  Applies a method to detect faces in the source image and applies the rectangular crop on either the `biggest` face or `all` of the faces detected. Image & Video Manager tries to preserve faces in the image instead of using specified crop coordinates.

    description: |
      Specifies how to crop or scale a crop area for the faces detected in the source image, `zoom` by default. The output image resizes to the specified `width` and `height` values. A value of `crop` places a raw crop around the faces, relative to the specified `gravity` value.  A value of `fill` scales the crop area to include as much of the image and faces as possible, relative to the specified `width` and `height` values. A value of `zoom` scales the crop area as small as possible to fit the faces, relative to the specified `width` and `height` values.

  algorithm:
    description: |
      Specifies the type of algorithm used to detect faces in the image, either `cascade` for the cascade classifier algorithm or `dnn` for the deep neural network algorithm, `cascade` by default.

  confidence:
    description: |
      With `algorithm` set to `dnn`, specifies the minimum confidence needed to detect faces in the image. Values range from `0` to `1` for increased confidence, and possibly fewer faces detected.

      Controls placement of the crop if Image & Video Manager does not detect any faces in the image. Directions are relative to the edges of the image being transformed.

    description: |
      Distinguishes the faces detected, either `biggestFace` or `allFaces` to place the crop rectangle around the full set of faces. This is `all` by default.

  padding:
    description: |
      The padding ratio based on the dimensions of the biggest face detected, `0.5` by default. Larger values increase padding.
