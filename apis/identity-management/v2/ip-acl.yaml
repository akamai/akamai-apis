        Enable or disable  an existing CIDR block, update comments, IP address, or range  in the CIDR block. Note that you can only update a CIDR block  with IP allowlist enabled on the account. There are several  CIDR blocks on the allowlist and your attempt to make changes  to the CIDR block is from an IP address that's on the allowlist.  You can't edit the last CIDR block in the allowlist or the CIDR  block allowing access to the current user.

      tags:
      - CIDR blocks
      description: |
        After you delete a CIDR block from the allowlist, any requests from IP addresses you deleted  fail the next time someone tries to log in from that address.   Users accessing Control Center from an IP address you delete aren't automatically logged out of Control Center at the time  you delete the IP address. With IP allowlist enabled for the  account, you can't delete the last CIDR block in the allowlist  or the CIDR block allowing access to the current user. There  are no restrictions with IP allowlist disabled on the account.
