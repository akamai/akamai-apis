    get:
      operationId: get-move-affected-users
      summary: List users affected by moving a group
      tags:
      - Move groups
      description: |
        List users who are affected when a group is moved. Users may lose or gain access to resources depending on the roles and permissions associated with the new parent group. Users with a `userType` of `lostAccess` lose their access to the source group. If the `userType` is `gainAccess`, they gain access to the resources in the source group. Users who have inherited access to a group lose access to that group if it moves out of its the hierarchy that gives them those access rights. If the group moves to another parent group to which they have access, they still have access to the group you move. Likewise, when a group is moved to its new location, users who inherit their access rights from the new parent group gain access to the resources in the group you move.
