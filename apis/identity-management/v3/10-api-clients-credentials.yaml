        This operation creates a new credential for your API client. Only you may create credentials for this client. Credentials are in `active` status at creation. They expire two years from their creation date. However, when the API client's permissions are based on Control Center permissions, credentials expire differently and follow the same rotation schedule listed for user passwords on those accounts. Run the [Update a credential](ref:put-client-credential) operation to change the expiration date, description, or status. Save the values from the response, such as the `credentialID` for future use. This is the only time you'll see the client secret. Save the credential at this time to avoid the need to create a new one.
