      description: 'This operation lists users who are affected when you move a group.
        Users may lose or gain access to resources depending on the roles and permissions
        inherited from the new parent group. Users with a `userType` of `lostAccess`
        lose their access to the source group. If the `userType` is `gainAccess`,
        they gain access to the resources in the source group. Users who have inherited
        access to a group lose access to that group if it moves out of its hierarchy
        that gives them those access rights. If the group moves to another parent
        group to which they have access, they still have access to the group you move.
        Likewise, when you move a group to a new location, users who inherit their
        access rights from the new parent group gain access to the resources in the
        group you move.
