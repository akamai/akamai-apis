  roleId:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Unique identifier for each role. To get this value, run the [List roles](ref:get-roles) operation. You need to assign at least one role to a user. Setting the value to `null` in POST leaves the default role: either unassigned or cascaded from a parent group. For `PUT`, it clears the current assignment and reverts it to the default role.

    description: |
      Children of the parent group. Permissions cascade downward from parent to child unless the child group's `isBlocked` is `true`.
