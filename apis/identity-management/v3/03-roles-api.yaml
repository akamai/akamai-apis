      description: |
        This operation creates a custom role. A custom role combines [grantable roles](ref:get-grantable-roles) defined by Akamai. Roles exist at the account level regardless of group, but are constrained by contract type. If you create a role under one contract type, you can't apply that role to groups belonging to a different contract type, even if they're in the same account.
