        This operation adds CIDR blocks to your account's allowlist. You can add only one CIDR block at a time. Before creating the CIDR block, you may want to [validate it](ref:get-allowlist-validate), to check if its format is correct.

        This operation enables or disables an existing CIDR block, updates comments, IP addresses, or ranges in the CIDR block. Note that you can only update a CIDR block with IP allowlist enabled on the account. There are several CIDR blocks on the allowlist and your attempt to make changes to the CIDR block is from an IP address that's on the allowlist. You can't edit the last CIDR block in the allowlist or the CIDR block allowing access to the current user.

      summary: Delete a CIDR block
      tags:
      - CIDR blocks
      description: |
        This operation deletes a CIDR block from the IP allowlist. After you delete a CIDR block, any requests from IP addresses you deleted fail the next time someone tries to log in from that address. Users accessing Control Center from an IP address you delete aren't automatically logged out of Control Center at the time you delete the IP address. With IP allowlist enabled for the account, you can't delete the last CIDR block in the allowlist or the CIDR block allowing access to the current user. There are no restrictions with IP allowlist disabled on the account.
