        The response object contains the `accountSwitchKeys` and account names you can access based on the permissions of your API client. Once you have the `accountSwitchKeys` you need, [you can make an API call to another account](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/manage-many-accounts-with-one-api-client).

      summary: Create a credential
      description: |
        Create a new credential for an API client. Only the owner of an identity can create credentials for it.  Credentials are in `active` status at creation, and by  default expire two years from their creation date.  However, credentials expire differently when the API client is based on Control Center user permissions, and follow the same rotation schedule  listed for user passwords on those accounts. Run the [Update a credential](ref:put-identity-credential) operation to change the expiration date, description or status.  Save information from the response information like the `credentialID` for future use.  This is the only time you will see the client secret. If you do not save it at this time, you will need to create a new credential.
