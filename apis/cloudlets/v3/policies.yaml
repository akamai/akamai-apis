        Creates a shared policy for a specific Cloudlet type. Currently, you can create a shared policy for the API Prioritization, Edge Redirector, Forward Rewrite, Request Control, Phased Release, Virtual Waiting Room, and Audience Segmentation Cloudlets. You can then add match rules by [creating a policy version](ref:post-policy-version). If a policy already exists with the same policy name, you receive a 409 status response that contains data for the existing policy.

      tags:
      - Policies
      description: |
        Clones the staging, production, and last modified versions of a non-shared (API v2) or shared policy into a new shared policy. You can also specify any additional versions that you want to clone into the new shared policy. The policy ID is required. If you don't already have the policy ID, use [List shared policies](ref:get-policies) or [List policies](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloudlets/v2/reference/get-policies) and note the `id` or `policyId` value. When cloning a non-shared policy to a shared policy, a group ID (`groupId`) is required. Policies created using API v2 do not require a `groupId`, so the non-shared policy that you are cloning may or may not have this data member. If the policy you are cloning doesnâ€™t have a `groupId`, assign one while performing this operation. To check if the non-shared policy has a `groupId`, see [List policies](https://techdocs.akamai.com/cloudlets/v2/reference/get-policies).
