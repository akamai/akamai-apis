      The rule's unique identifier.

  matchesAlways:
    type: boolean

  redirectURL:
    type: string
    description: |
      The URL Edge Redirector redirects the request to. If using `useRelativeUrl`, you can enter a path for the value. If `useRelativeUrl` is not used or set to `none`, then the `redirectUrl` should be a fully qualified URL.

    description: |
      The HTTP response redirect type status code: `301` for permanent redirect, `302` for temporary redirect, `303` for temporary using GET, `307` for temporary retain method, or `308` for permanent retain method.
    enum:

  useIncomingQueryString:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set to `true`, the Cloudlet includes the requests' query string in the rewritten or forwarded URL.
  useIncomingSchemeAndHost:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      If set to `true`, the Cloudlet copies both the scheme and the hostname from the incoming request to use in the redirect URL.
  useRelativeUrl:
    type: string
    description: |
      If set to `relative_url`, takes the path entered for the `redirectUrl` and sets it in the response’s `Location` header. The client browser receiving the request decides which protocol and hostname to use. If set to `copy_scheme_hostname`, it creates an absolute path by taking the protocol and hostname from the incoming request and combining them with path information entered for the `redirectUrl`. This absolute path is set in the response’s `Location` header. If you don't include `useRelativeUrl`, or if you set it to `none`, then specify the `redirectUrl` as a fully qualified URL.
    enum:
    - none
    - copy_scheme_hostname
    - relative_url
