    properties:
      aggregation:
        type: number
        description: |
          The time span included in each record, expressed in seconds.
      endTimeInEpoch:
        type: number
        description: |
          The end of the requested time range, in epoch seconds.
      hasMoreData:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Indicates that a constrained set of requested data does not represent the entire set.
      limit:
        type: number
        description: |
          The maximum number of requested data `rows`.
      offset:
        type: number
        description: |
          The offset of the row from which the data should start. Used with overall `limit`, it reflects where a batch of data starts. For example, setting both `offset` and `limit` to `100` selects rows 101-200 from the overall results.
      startTimeInEpoch:
        type: number
        description: |
          The start of the requested time range, in epoch seconds.
      timeZone:
        type: string
        description: |
          Identifies the time zone from which the request was made.
