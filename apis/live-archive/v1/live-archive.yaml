To retain archived content beyond 31 days, use this operation to create a separate VOD asset that MSL stores in Akamai NetStorage. You need to set up the desired NetStorage storage group using the [Live-to-VOD Export](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/webhelp/media-services-live/media-services-live-4-user-guide/GUID-039CB50F-CB56-49D8-BBDF-E6675E159023.html) option in Akamai Control Center.
