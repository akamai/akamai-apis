        Overrides the default database Data Access Policy. If not specified, the applied Data Access Policy will be the default Data Access Policy effective for all newly created namespaces. The default database Data Access Policy is defined when first initializing EdgeKV. The effective settings for new namespaces can also be changed using the modify Data Access Policy endpoint after initialization. The applied Data Access Policy can't be changed after the namespace is created.

            Indicates if the default Data Access Policy of the database has been `inherited` or `overridden` when the namespace was created.

            Set a Data Access Policy to apply only for the current namespace that overrides the default setting. Changing the Data Access Policy for a namespace is only possible if namespace policy override is set to allowed by setting `allowNamespacePolicyOverride` to `true` when first initializing EdgeKV. The endpoint to modify the default Data Access Policy settings can also be used after initialization to change effective settings.

      description: |
        Specifies the storage location for data when creating a namespace on the production network. This can help optimize performance by storing data where most or all of your users are located. The value defaults to `US` on the `STAGING` and `PRODUCTION` networks. The available locations also include `EU` (Europe) and `JP` (Japan) for the `PRODUCTION` network. Once you create this value, you can't modify it.

        The Akamai access group the namespace is assigned to. A value of `0` makes the namespace available to all Akamai access groups on the account with EdgeKV capabilities.
